5.0,"Great Investment for a PS4 Owner. 
Nephew gave me his PS4 as he bought a PS5.  One of my main concerns after playing GTA 5 online with him is the system was always hot and I could notice this in game play as my game play would seem to be effected.  After looking to see if there were any items out there such as a cooling fan I found this item.  Its a 3 in 1 package.  The main feature is a cooling fan which was the main thing I was looking for but it also provides you with two charging stations for your PS4 controllers as well as an upright game storage rack of sorts.  It also provides you with a USB connection to run a charging cable to your controller if you in the process of playing a game thats really long.  Its a great item to have as heat will destroy your console eventually if you dont take care of your stuff.

I’ve never had a stand for any of my consoles until my PS4 slim was sounding like an airliner ready to take off. Although this has not fully negated that (game issues), it does help keep my PS4 cool. The two charging docks to charge my controllers was worth the price alone. As a bonus, it holds all the games I own creating a nice, tidy gaming station. This is also very quiet we’re I do not know it’s even on. If you’re like me and never owned one, I highly suggest you invest in one of these. Absolute convenience and all your gaming gear is in one place ready for action.

What I did like:*The size of the stand. It's relatively high from the ground, which is what I want.*The fan cannot be turned on unless the PS4 is on. It uses he PS4's power.*The charging glow is accurate (red or green), and the controllers actually charge. It's very convenient that you can use one and charge the other.*Well designed and a nice layout. The cord in the front is the ""charging cable"" that connects the controller to the PS4 (got the cord with the new PS4, Sony). The game slots were a nice touch, but I don't like using them.*It fit perfectly inside of the slot, EXCEPTWhat I didn't like:*The PS4 wobbled. It was a bit loose, so when I moved it it would wiggle a bit*The on button for the fan is hard to reach. It's under the PS4 by the USB cable.*The game case slots are not optional and cannot be removed.*I doesn't bother me personally, but the fan might be a little too loud for some people. I can feel the air, but it's not super powerful, and wouldn't do a whole ton if you were playing for many hours straight.

3.0,"Great stand, game organizer, and controller charger. Cooling, not so much. 
This product can be great, depending on what you need it for. I own the original PS4. I bought this to provide more cooling when playing more demanding games like RDR2 and TLOU part II so that my console didn't sound like it was about to take off on an airport run way. This product arrived, I took my PS4 apart, cleaned out the dust and set it up. The console looks great on the stand, it's quiet, the chargers work fantastically and are faster than the USB cable, you also have the option to stand your games in it as well (I didn't really use it so I will not speak about that part). Unfortunately, in my opinion, these are the only pros regarding this product.You will need to plug the product to your console's USB port. You can use other options like a mobile phone power block, or a power power strip with USB ports, but you will have to power the product off separately from the console. You will need to power it on(by pressing a button on the device), separately no matter if you plug it into the console or another option.The cooling fans suck. They are very quiet, you will need to put your ear next to the console to hear it working. However, testing my console using the stand vs my console by itself, playing the same games, my console is more likely to sound like it's about blow up when using the stand than by itself. It disappointed me. I wouldn't mind if the stand was little louder if it meant sufficient cooling to my console.So, if you're looking to set up your console vertically, organize your gaming area a little more or to charge your controllers a little faster, than this will work for you. If you're looking to keep your console a little cooler and quieter while you're playing, keep looking.

The game holder is ok and it’s kind of unnecessary and I personally would prefer if it skipped that feature in favor of a smaller profile.

To give an honest review I wanted to use this product for my PS4 for a month.I read all of the negative reviews before my purchase. When your PS4 sounds like a 747 taking off like mine does Its to late. This product will not work miracles & miraculously eliminate the loud noise from the dying fan. However If your PS4 fan Is not at that point yet I believe It will help keep your PS4 cooler which will extend the life of your fan. I have checked the air coming out of the back at different times & I do play from  2 to 6 hours a day. I can feel the hot air blowing out which tells me the 2 small fans are doing what their intended for.If your PS4 fan sounds like mine you have to take In consideration if you bought It when released In 2014 like I did. That's going on 7 years, I rarely cleaned the inside & was enclosed In my TV stand which Is a big reason why they will overheat & your fan works harder then It should to cool the system.If your like me & have been attempting to buy a PS5 before my PS4 fan dies look at replacing the fan as I just did since Its a miracle to get a PS5. It runs just like new, cost $135 installed & mine came with  a year warranty. I live In California so It's probably a lot cheaper elsewhere. You can locate local shops that service PS4 , they usually advertise as cell phone / electronics repair so call & ask If they service PS4 as I did.My only negative findings....You do have to push the button to turn fan on even though the stand / charging dock will turn on once your PS4 Is powered up. It's mind boggling because the fans will turn off once you turn off your PS4.Be extremely careful when removing controllers on charging station. When you pull up Its a given your hand will hit the PS4 & due to the vertical position It will flip the PS4 right out of the stand. I would place your hand on top of PS4 to hold it down as you remove your controllers.To conclude this review with a few more details.The storage slots seem to work fine for game cases, the 2 fans are not that loud, Its a really simple set up & the lights on controller charging station go off once controllers are charged.I would recommend purchasing If your PS4 fan isn't already loud like I mentioned above.

I'm very glad I got this.  It keeps my Playstation cooler and it's very quiet. I honestly don't even notice when it's on. The recharge ports for the controllers are also nice but I only use 1 and the system has to be on for them to charge so I don't use that feature as much. But for people with multi controllers I'm sure it would be a huge help. Plus it's a nice place to keep them when not in use. If you use your system a lot like I do,  I highly recommend. It's a good investment to keep your system going longer.

PROS:- I was surprised at how much it kept my regular PS4 upright even after pushing it pretty hard- The controller chargers work well & are at a convenient angle- The fans are more of a small breeze but I like it bc it helps the console not overheat while also not being loud (at least not louder than the actual PS4 when it’s on); the fan is turned on and off by a buttonCONS:- The isn’t any indication that the fans are on unless you lift up the console to check or put your ears really close to hear it turn on/off- There isn’t much grip where the console meets the fan base and when I accidentally push it (as shown toward the end of the video), it slides around more than I’d like. It’s not super slippery but just more than I expectedI noticed a temperature difference in that the console is not as hot as usual when the fan is on. Overall, a great product that helps me feel better about leaving the PS4 on overnight in ‘rest mode’ for installations or updates!

The console cooler/charger is a good design. It will charge the wireless controller in about 1 hour approx. It will flash green when the controller is fully charged. The vertical mount allows more surface area to be cooled down. A really good design improvement would be to have a stronger, higher output fan and variable fan speeds. Any of the Sony Playstation consoles from 1 through 5 run hot. So they need to be cooled in any way possible. This one does a good job but could be improved upon.

Wanting a cooling fan for my PS4 that also had some addition charging ports for the joysticks. Since the PS4 only has only 2 USB ports on the font, you could only charge 2 joystick at a time.  With this cooling station, there were two charging docks that allows you to charge 2 joysticks by using one of the USB ports on the PS4, plus there is additional USB plug on the base of the cooling station so you can plug an additional cable into there to charge an an additional joystick. However, I don’t know if it’s that there is enough power to be charging 3 joystick plus using It to power the cooling fan also.Only annoying thing with cooling fan is that you have to press a button on the front of the cooling station in order to turn it on.  So you have to manually walk over to the cooling station every time I order to turn it on.  Wish it was a switch that you jus leave on so you could leave it on permanently. That way as soon as you turn on your PS4, it would power up the USB port and turn on the fan automatically. And if you put the PS4 to sleep, it will turn of the power to the USB ports after a specific amount of time and would automatically turn the fan off for you.

The LED lights change from red to green to represent whether or not it's charging.Fits PlayStation CD cases perfectly.I use it as a headset stand holder, but that's only because I download my games digitally.

Seems to be doing a good job, i like how it showd when the controller was done charging. 2 improvements needed would be adding mounting spots somwhere and the charging station require enough force to remove the controller that my 6 year old ends up pulling so hard he wacks right into the PS4 (also causing the whole unit to left and shift, hence the mounting spots recommendation) so chaning the location or at least the angle at which the controller sits would be nice improvements .

Super quick ship. Easy plug n play. Even fully charged three controllers that havent been used in about a year or more. Two won't charge period from regular micro USB.So impressed that we will have the spares. Yes, I need to replace internal batts and other parts of the controllers, but man, happy surprise.Base is firm on a glass shelf. So glad I saw this in a review of many. Only thing it lacks is a holder for external drive. No more extra long USB cable!!!

Seems quality build. Not sure why it needs a “metal base plate” as described, as it pulls air from bottom of base into the side of the ps4... but whatever.  I like the look of it, functional with clearing clutter, game holder a bonus.Docked a star from the noise, its louder than my 4 year old ps4 that I recently re-thermaled and cleaned thoroughly.I dont want to dock a star - but i will point out that w/o a light on u really have to listen for it vs the boot up fan w powering ps4 on.Also i dont like that it doesn’t just turn on when u power the ps4 up- so u HAVE to hit the on button on the fan also.Last thing, the older model had 3 fans and no metal base- this has 2 w metal base// id prefer more fans. As far as i can tell, the base has to be lifted with something to draw air- and there isnt “holes” in the design... which begs the question, where is the air coming from and why is the metal base so damn important?

It's really convenient for small spaces and de-cluttering to have all of these functions in one object (stand, dual controller charger, fan, game shelf).A couple of complaints:-Two of the slots that hold the game cases are just a tad too wide, so those slots don't hold the games very well. Fortunately, I don't have enough hard-copy games to fill all the slots, so I just don't use the defective slots.-Putting the controllers onto the chargers is not as simple as just placing them there like it is with any charging station I've ever had before. With my unit, it takes two hands and some force. It's not a super big deal, but a slight annoyance.

This is a perfect definition of hitting 4 birds in 1 stone, all I want actually was to have a stand for my PS4 Pro as obviously (first pic) I run out of space on my entertainment console for another gaming console. The whole intention was for it is to set on top of my subwoofer besides the TV. Upon searching for stand, i came across for this 4 in 1 stand/cooler/charger/storage. Although, its a $10 more compare to a what i saw on a simple stand, I believe its still a heck of a deal for me knowing you can actually charge your controller on it as well. A 2 controller charger will easily cost me $20 or more setting aside from the space that it would occupy which i dont have. Now, lets talk about the product. It is obviously a stand that you could use in any ps4 model (normal,slim and pro) that has 2 cooling fans that could help suck out the warm air coming from the unit. Besides it is a 2 dock controller charger with cool indication lights that you could see even from afar (its huge lighted sign) and on the other side is 12 pcs game storage. Unfortunately, i only have a single game right now which I donwloaded from PS store so i havent really tried that side yet with a PS4 game disk; i tried it with the xbox1 one though and it fits right so far. I would easily recommend this especially to those people like me that has limited space as this is a good space saver accesory.

I like this thing a lot. It’s ready to go right out of the box and holds my slim very well, it’s not wobbly and I’m not worried about it falling out. Controller chargers work well and let you know when they’re done charging. Holds 12 games.I knocked a star off due to two slightly annoying factors, the first being that there is no on/off switch for the unit, so unless you want it charging your controllers/running all night, you need to unplug the thing. There is an on/off button for the just the fan, which is a nice touch. Fan is very quiet but you can still hear it if you put your ear to it to know it works.The second slightly annoying issue is that several of the slots that hold the 12 games are inaccurately/awkwardly spaced, meaning a couple of games are not adequately held by the slots and sit loosely/lean against the other games. These aren’t dealbreakers for the price at all.Overall, I’m pretty happy with this purchase and would recommend.

5.0,"A Great All Encompassing PS4 Accessory. 
I play 5+ hours a week on a  PlayStation4 Pro and as many of you may know the PS4 Pro can sound like a jet taking off when it starts to overheat. I was looking for a solution that would solve my issue without breaking the band and this does just this. It is a self-powered cooler (plug it into the PS4 with micro USB) that works very well. It has removable parts so that you can fit any PlayStation depending on your model. On top of that, there are two slots for you to charge your controllers with LED indicators on whether your controller is charging or charged. I was worried that the charging stand would take longer to fully charge the controllers but I didn't notice any change in time and it's really nice not dealing with a bunch of wires. I play mainly digital but there are also slots for you to store your game behind the PlayStation which would be super useful for people who play mainly physical. It is made out of plastic but it is well made and I'd recommend this to anybody who is looking for a quality cooler/charger combo that won't break the bank.

5.0,"A Great All Encompassing PS4 Accessory. 
I play 5+ hours a week on a  PlayStation4 Pro and as many of you may know the PS4 Pro can sound like a jet taking off when it starts to overheat. I was looking for a solution that would solve my issue without breaking the band and this does just this. It is a self-powered cooler (plug it into the PS4 with micro USB) that works very well. It has removable parts so that you can fit any PlayStation depending on your model.

Super quiet so I love it!!! Bought this for my other half as he has the PS4 Slim and it fits perfectly and u can also remove the slot for the slim if u have the other PS4s. When you drop the control on it to charge it lights up red when it’s charging or green when it’s finished. Beautiful design. The only thing I’m not so fond of are the slots for the games. It will hold the games if you do not plan to move the device around but if you have to move it the games will fall out. Think the slots there need to be a little deeper to keep the games more secure. Great value for money though and I would definitely recommend!!!

The OIVO  cooling station comes with an adapter to use with the PS4 Slim but the PS4 Slim will only fit one way on the adapter which will only fit the left side of the PS4 Slim where there is 1 vent. The cooling station has 2 fans which is great only if the adapter would fit the PS4 Slim on the right side where there are 2 vents on the PS4 Slim. If the adapter was made to fit the right side of the PS4, the 2 cooling fans would line up perfectly with the 2 vents on the PS4.I've tried the adapter on the right side of the PS4 Slim but since the adapter only fits the cooling station one way, The PS4 will face the wrong way...if your wanting it to face backwards.

Does what it says and needs to. No issue with mine. Mostly got it as a stand and charger because my old one broke but the fans a plus, though its not so powerful however pretty quiet. The game shelf on the other side is definitely a big step up from JUST the fan/stand and charger.Only thing i would say could be different is having another one or 2 extra USBs as my old one had 3 open extra ports so i im used to that but all around nice product.  The only other thing i could think of us is maybe maybe 2 different models so the customer can choose if they want the shelf/charger on the left/right depending on their gaming set up.To add the Light up notifications are also cool.

Great unit.  Works great, looks nice, adds organization while decreasing footprint of existing equipment - what's not to love?  (obvious a parent wrote this yet?)PROSLooks fantastic, small footprint (with unit standing vertically),QUIET, like no noise I can really hear over ambient living room noise.Kept unit much cooler to the touch, although it's didn't bring back our rifles/sights in COD.  That bug's apparently not heat related.Charging for controllers is really nice, and they look better than on other units i've seenStorage for games in back is nice.  Current boxes don't really let you install more than 4-5 games anyway, so the storage is about perfectCONSThe only thing I can think to say is not a con, but a fact of manufacture.  This unit is made for multiple units, so if your PS doesn't fit, remove the inner sleeve to open up more room in the cradle.  It took us a minute to figure that out.

4.0,"Much Better. 
I had ordered what I thought was this product but it turns out the one I ordered the one with the three LED lights on the fans and no LED indicators on the front for charging. Well I chatted with customer service and they made it so easy to get the one I wanted. I ordered this one and it came right away and works just as I wanted it to. As soon as I returned the one that was wrong they right away refunded my money.Now for the product review, this product does exactly what it says it will do, these fans are bigger and there is only two of them but seems to keep my PlayStation much cooler than the first one I ordered. This one doesn't have any LED lights on the fans which is ok because you can't see them anyway when your PlayStation is on it. The charging indicators are a nice feature I like to know how much charge my controllers have. Overall its a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for this kind of product.

So I just brought a new docking station 4 my ps4. I loved it. It stands out really well. The dock can hold 2 controllers and 12 ps4 games of your choice. It also save space on your desk if you don't have enough space. It also comes with a small usb to plug your console to the docking station. I gave it 4 stars because it does not charge when it is powered off. It only charges when it is on. Also the box came in damaged. Its not that bad it is still damage on the corners of the box.
