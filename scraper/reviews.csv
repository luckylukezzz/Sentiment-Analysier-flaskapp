5.0,"From Oneplus 9Pro to Pixel 8, Massive Upgrade. 
My old Oneplus 9pro was a handmedown from my dad. It lasted a while, all the way from when it came out. Still not very slow, battery life was definitely lacking on that thing.But this 100% feels like an upgrade. That old phone only went up to Android 13, while this one came with 14. Snapchat makes proper use of the Android camera API for the pixel, so my photos look wayyyy more crisp on this phone. The camera on this phone is a bit meh in comparison to the oneplus I had, but the macro lens is pretty amazing on this phone.I use bitwarden and it would almost never autofill on my oneplus, but this autofills on every single app I've tried, the app integration and amount of random little QoL features are amazing.I'm not a fan of the default home launcher, but after installing lawn chair 14, I have way more customizability and I was able to really make this phone feel like my own.The battery life is wonderful, I was a bit worried that it wouldn't have much because it's not the ""pro"" version of the phone but it lasts me ~1.5 days with pretty regular usage. Even while using the 120hz display.The size feels way more comfortable than the the massive oneplus, and I'm honestly glad I didn't get the 8 pro. I have pretty big hands, I don't know who they're making these huge phones for. If you want to watch movies with a large screen, just get a cheap tablet. This is for messaging and day-to-day usage, and it works perfectly for that. It feels comfortable in the pocket too, paired with the Mous case I bought for it. This phone does everything I need it to, and I have almost no complaints.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



My S22 ultra was having screen line and other issues, and I was disappointed because the phone was just over 2 years old. I didn't have plans on getting a new phone, but I had no choice. I decided NOT to go back with a Samsung phone. So the PIXEL 8 PRO was my only option, hearing the good things about pixel phones and the cameras. After 2 weeks with the phone, this is my experience.Negatives: The selfie camera do take out good pictures and videos in good lighting but low light no so good. Rear cameras are better in the dark.Speakers are loud, but sounds a little flat to me.Positives: The form factor is nice, even tho a bit smaller than my s22 ultra. Fits perfect in the pocket.The UI is fluid and smooth, animations are nice. The Screen is nice, vivid and bright. The videos are way superior on the Pixel 8 pro, better stabilization, better colors, better zoom than my S22U. Post edit tools are a plus to adjust pics and vids to your preference. Magic eraser does work pretty nice. Cinematic photos are cool. Battery is good. I can go all day without a charge, with heavy usage. NO OVERHEATING issues like some people was saying.Overall, the phone is a great phone with strong cameras to compete with the best flagships in 2024.The only advantage my S22U has is the S-PEN other than that I'm good with the PIXEL 8 PRO. #TEAMPIXEL for life.

Works well and I love the google AI that screens calls.  It's very human sounding and works better than any other call screen service I have ever used.****IMPORTANT NOTE****  Asurion is a scam.  In my experience, If you ever have to file a claim they will make the process as difficult as possible.  When you sign in to the app to file a claim you have to sign in three separate times.  The form they want you to fill out does not self-populate your name, address, phone # etc.  You’ll then need to enter various other information, and they want a pic of both the front and back of your driver’s license (remember, you logged in with a UN and PW).  Once you upload all of this, they tell you it will take 24 business hours to review.  First, they reject the form stating you must print and sign the form even though it says you can sign electronically.  If you call their number, they will place your call on hold for a while and initially an automated message will attempt to tie up your call having you answer various questions.  Eventually someone in a foreign country will answer your call.  The initial person will try to sell you additional services and after you say no a couple times, they will transfer you to someone else.  You guessed it, you will have to be on hold again.  You will get transferred and placed on hold several more times and they will find a way to deny your claim.  What is especially frustrating is you have followed all their directions along the way.  They can (and will) raise service fees without any notice.  In the end, you will not save any money and have spent far too much time submitting forms and talking to people that lie and misdirect you every step of the way.  The company’s employees are dishonest and have no problem lying to you.  You can give it a try if you want but you have been warned.  Instead of paying their monthly fee dump the money in a savings account.  Odds are you’ll be able to buy a new product that’s updated, and you will receive it in a couple of days instead of weeks later.  Asurion Protection is a scam.

ALL apps were lumped together and could only see if you swiped up. UGH. I like being more organized, so I got my separate screens in settings and organized my most used.

Thankfully technology and smart phones have reached a point that is so high that it's achievable to be a great phone if the manufacturer is willing to invest in it's product and Google has done that here; anyone that requires more, there is no pleasing you.... This is a phone to hang onto for the long run which was the main reason I bought this. Goes great with a leather wallet case and privacy glass screen protector. It also has wireless charging but I don't think I'll ever use that feature, and it gives the option to wirelessly charge other devices. This phone works better than other peoples PCs IMO. Well worth the investment. Also, it has a feature to use ""normal"" screen color shades or ""vivid"" color shades and its beautiful. Probably the best Android phone on the market. I also bought this phone refurbished and it's like a brand new phone(don't think people understand someone could open & close a box and thats what makes it ""used"" for becoming refurbished), sold and shipped by Amazon for 50% off the full price. My previous phone was from 2018.Pros: Water resistant, comes with Google photo editing for free, loads of actual useful security features, amazing camera, nice weight, feels like high quality, AMAZING stereo speakers(sounds like it has a bass speaker inside too and it sounds nice), awesome screen, customizable battery saving mode to disable/enable apps(very nice).Cons: its not invincible, battery only lasts 1.5 days without battery saver mode on, can't extract moister from the air to give me a sip of water?....idk, cant imagine what more I need a phone to do at this point.

5.0,"Easy to upgrade. 
I upgraded to this Pixel 8 from my old Samsung S9 phone.  It went smoothly.  Almost all the apps got transferred over without effort, all I had to do was reenter some app passwords.  The camera takes really clear shots at good res.  The fingerprint sensor is in the middle-lower part of the screen and works great.  Best of all, no Bixby, and little or no bloatware.  Minor annoyance that it feeds ads for Google phone products, but I found where to turn it off.  That's a good thing about Google flavor of Android, notifications have a little menu button built in so you can quickly find how to turn off those you don't want to be bothered with.  BTW this does fit in my 2020 Tesla Model 3 wireless phone charger, but with a protective otterbox case on it, the phone shelf cover won't close, but that's not a deal breaker for me.

I got this phone when it was 'on sale' for around 800$ (I forgot the exact amount but I payed 940 in total for a phone case as well. Not really a bad price compared to Samsung) I use this phone nearly everyday ranging from 6~8 hours of listening to content or doing something on here. The battery life is really good for what I do needing to charge it every now and then. The pictures that can be taken on this are pretty nice. I love the amount of details. look up YouTube videos on this phone. I don't use all of the features on this phone but I use most of them. As well as game just a bit.I've also got pretty small hands so the size and weight of the phone is a bit to big for me but the screen is really what I got it for when I'm outside. It's easy to use as well and simple. I wish there was more to the flash light because you can dim the light to a low level.I'll probably update this more as I use it but if you want a phone forever I'm keeping this.Update 6-29After using this phone more I've noticed some bugs/problems.If you're using developer mode I've noticed after a reboot it turns off certain things.One time the battery couldn't read its own percentage and the screen wasn't working (if this happens hold power and up volume for 10~20 seconds) but still phone shouldn't do this.People have said about this found that there's a problem with infinite loading, close out of the app.7-25I don't really know how to feel about this phone. It's buggy with certain apps, it crashes on its own installed apps. I enjoy some of the features of this phone but I'd actually want a phone I can use. I hope google keeps their word with the updates they're going to give. But giving it's google.Been having so much trouble just transferring files onto a USB stick. Errors after errors, at one point I sent 110 files through quickshare onto it and 90 of them were corrupted on the computer. It's a bit disappointing since these were photos. I had more of a better time individually dragging each file and making sure it transfers. I didn't have the patience for that. I'll do it again another time but here's your warning for if it happens to you. This phone is both smart and stupid at the same time. I dislike most AI models even Google's had some controversy in the past months for telling people to put glue in their pizza from a Reddit thread. You can text the AI it's good for small things like asking a questions. I don't know how smart you can get with them but always fact check. It's horrible with conversations, it's okay at first it shows interest like a person asking questions about what you're talking about then if you reply wrong it throws a monkey wrench and goes based on the new thing you typed.Typing... Everyone says typing is really good on here. Yes and no. Yes in the way that it's smarter because of some of the AI and the proof read. Voice typing can be amazing but it has it's problems that make me a bit frustrated. I hate when I'm doing it and it mishears me or it doesn't get what I say. You're still better off if you can type. But about 85% of the time it works right.I don't absolutely hate this phone I just have my slight annoyances with it. I love how fast it is and the camera is amazing (not the selfie camera.)8-25 update: with the Google pixel 9 out hearing that there's more problems and the AI is just so  stupid. It makes me hate how companies put AI into everything nowadays. This phone is great sometimes. Takes good pictures. Rarely gets slow but it does have its problems. I've had inconsistent camera issues, the battery isn't really the best. There's cheaper phones that have good cameras and upgradeable storage. I recommend looking for them.

2.0,"The most disappointing phone I have ever purchased. 
I really, really wanted to love this phone but honestly, having experienced both, Samsung does Android better than Google does which is pretty sad.I'm coming from an S20 so much of my review will be in comparison to that.Pros- Screen is very bright- Face unlock is very good- The glossy back is beautiful and not such a dramatic slip-hazard or fingerprint magnet as online video reviewers make it out to be.- That's it. Seriously.Cons (brace yourself)- Absolutely no idea how they managed this, but there is not even half the customisation ability as Samsung's version of Android and the stock Android experience is uglier and less logical than Samsung's version of it.I cannot express this enough, it's unbelievably irritating. Things you could change on a Samsung you're stuck with on the Pixel and many of these things look ugly or make things inconvenient. For example, want to quickly turn on/off mobile data? You can't with a easy button in the quick settings panel, you need now open a submenu called 'internet'. Want to change your quick settings tab colour to anything other than black? Too bad. Want to quickly switch your phone to vibrate? There's no quick setting for that either, it's a 3 step process now....You can't get rid of their mostly-useless 'at a glance' widget or even move it anywhere.- Entire UI on the default launcher is almost deliberately unintuitive and clunky. To change the brightness you have to swipe down twice, whereas it's right at the top with a single swipe on other phones. Just imagine the most logical place you'd expect something to work, and it'll be the exact opposite on this phone. e.g. do you want to clear all the recent apps? It won't be on a convenient button as soon as you press the recent apps navigation button, no, instead you have to swipe aaaaaaaall the way to the left through the 20 or 30 or so apps you may have opened and then the 'clear all' button will be at the end of the list. Seriously, has anyone who designed this launcher spent even 10 seconds thinking about any of these things before they implemented it???- The only option for a torch shortcut function is to double-tap the back of the phone.... it's exactly as reliable as you'd imagine - so absolutely terrible - the action you need to do leaves you teetering your phone in your hand so it's a huge drop risk and it actually responding to those taps only works 10% of the time at best so you just end up hitting your phone like a nutcase trying to get your torch to turn on. Samsung lets you double-press the power button - how much simpler and more logical is that?!- Battery doesn't have a charge limit feature like Samsung and other brands do. Instead it uses 'adaptive charging that forces your phone to charge suuuuuuper slowly when it thinks it's appropriate to e.g. in the evenings so that it's only fully charged by morning. Fine, except if you plan on topping up before you go out, you have to keep snoozing the function. If you happen to forget to snooze it, you'll come to grab your phone after an hour of sitting on charge and find it having gained only 5%.... brilliant, thanks Google... I would rather my phone charge super fast and stop at 90%. Give us the option at least. If I put my phone on charge I want it charged ASAP so it's ready to use when I need it. What's the point of rapid charging if it hardly uses it.- Basically the exact same dimensions as a Samsung S20 except for thickness and weight. Those differences are noticeable though as this thing feels like a brick in the hand. Feels very thick and very heavy whereas the S20 or even S20FE feels super sleek and light in comparison.- Despite the extra thickness and weight, the Pixel 8 is objectively worse spec'd and featured than many other flagships on the market, even some older phones. It doesn't even have a dual-SIM - I knew this before purchasing but it's standard on many flagships and laughably even mid-range phones have this so be aware of that if you intend to use this for work.- The screen has a nice subtle roundoff at the edges....that leads straight into a pointy raised metal lip of the chassis the whole way around. It feels sharp and unpleasant to swipe off the edge of the screen in any direction. It's already accumulating dust and I imagine it will get gross over time because it's nearly impossible to clean properly. It's such a large lip I can literally pull the phone along the table with my fingernail using just that edge.- The camera visor edges are also very sharp and can be uncomfortable depending on how you hold it, and when gaming. They are also easily scratched with how it sits on the very edge of the visor on the table.- The camera is missing a whole tonne of features qnd settings that again, are present on other phones. It doesn't even have an anti-flicker correction so videos with LED lighting in them will look like you're at a rave...The quality is also decidedly average, night mode is significantly worse than Samsung's and barely an improvement over regular mode.

It'll do its job and nothing more and it's definitely not worth the price. It doesn't hold a candle to the other flagships and Google's software-limiting of certain features to the Pro for no reason other than to split the product tiers is incredibly disappointing too. This is the first Pixel phone I've ever bought and without a doubt the last I will ever buy. A thouroughly rubbish experience.Considering the phone is physically subpar spec'd compared to the competition of compact phones like the Zenfone 10, Xiaomi 14, Sony 5V or even the now older Samsung S23 I would highly recommend looking at competitors' offerings before buying a Pixel 8. In fact I would just say buy a Samsung and enjoy your purchase. The Pixel 8 should be very last on your list.

2.0,"The most disappointing phone I have ever purchased. 
I really, really wanted to love this phone but honestly, having experienced both, Samsung does Android better than Google does which is pretty sad.I'm coming from an S20 so much of my review will be in comparison to that.Pros- Screen is very bright- Face unlock is very good- The glossy back is beautiful and not such a dramatic slip-hazard or fingerprint magnet as online video reviewers make it out to be.- That's it. Seriously.Cons (brace yourself)- Absolutely no idea how they managed this, but there is not even half the customisation ability as Samsung's version of Android and the stock Android experience is uglier and less logical than Samsung's version of it.I cannot express this enough, it's unbelievably irritating. Things you could change on a Samsung you're stuck with on the Pixel and many of these things look ugly or make things inconvenient. For example, want to quickly turn on/off mobile data? You can't with a easy button in the quick settings panel, you need now open a submenu called 'internet'. Want to change your quick settings tab colour to anything other than black? Too bad. Want to quickly switch your phone to vibrate? There's no quick setting for that either, it's a 3 step process now....You can't get rid of their mostly-useless 'at a glance' widget or even move it anywhere.- Entire UI on the default launcher is almost deliberately unintuitive and clunky. To change the brightness you have to swipe down twice, whereas it's right at the top with a single swipe on other phones. Just imagine the most logical place you'd expect something to work, and it'll be the exact opposite on this phone. e.g. do you want to clear all the recent apps? It won't be on a convenient button as soon as you press the recent apps navigation button, no, instead you have to swipe aaaaaaaall the way to the left through the 20 or 30 or so apps you may have opened and then the 'clear all' button will be at the end of the list. Seriously, has anyone who designed this launcher spent even 10 seconds thinking about any of these things before they implemented it???- The only option for a torch shortcut function is to double-tap the back of the phone.... it's exactly as reliable as you'd imagine - so absolutely terrible - the action you need to do leaves you teetering your phone in your hand so it's a huge drop risk and it actually responding to those taps only works 10% of the time at best so you just end up hitting your phone like a nutcase trying to get your torch to turn on. Samsung lets you double-press the power button - how much simpler and more logical is that?!- Battery doesn't have a charge limit feature like Samsung and other brands do. Instead it uses 'adaptive charging that forces your phone to charge suuuuuuper slowly when it thinks it's appropriate to e.g. in the evenings so that it's only fully charged by morning. Fine, except if you plan on topping up before you go out, you have to keep snoozing the function. If you happen to forget to snooze it, you'll come to grab your phone after an hour of sitting on charge and find it having gained only 5%.... brilliant, thanks Google... I would rather my phone charge super fast and stop at 90%. Give us the option at least. If I put my phone on charge I want it charged ASAP so it's ready to use when I need it. What's the point of rapid charging if it hardly uses it.- Basically the exact same dimensions as a Samsung S20 except for thickness and weight. Those differences are noticeable though as this thing feels like a brick in the hand. Feels very thick and very heavy whereas the S20 or even S20FE feels super sleek and light in comparison.- Despite the extra thickness and weight, the Pixel 8 is objectively worse spec'd and featured than many other flagships on the market, even some older phones. It doesn't even have a dual-SIM - I knew this before purchasing but it's standard on many flagships and laughably even mid-range phones have this so be aware of that if you intend to use this for work.- The screen has a nice subtle roundoff at the edges....that leads straight into a pointy raised metal lip of the chassis the whole way around. It feels sharp and unpleasant to swipe off the edge of the screen in any direction. It's already accumulating dust and I imagine it will get gross over time because it's nearly impossible to clean properly. It's such a large lip I can literally pull the phone along the table with my fingernail using just that edge.- The camera visor edges are also very sharp and can be uncomfortable depending on how you hold it, and when gaming. They are also easily scratched with how it sits on the very edge of the visor on the table.- The camera is missing a whole tonne of features qnd settings that again, are present on other phones. It doesn't even have an anti-flicker correction so videos with LED lighting in them will look like you're at a rave...The quality is also decidedly average, night mode is significantly worse than Samsung's and barely an improvement over regular mode. They have a night mode for video but software lock that to the Pixel 8 Pro just to make the 8 Pro more desireable. Why should 8 Standard owners get less features when it can handle the software just fine???- Thick bezels around the screen edges. Nothing major but most phones have managed near edge-to-edge screens 6 years ago... These bezels are actually slightly wider than my HTC One from a decade ago.- Doing intensive tasks or asking much of it will get it hot. It also freezes and becomes unresponsive while doing average things like browsing Chrome.

4.0,"Almost perfect, but falls short.. 
(4/5) After about 2 days of using, the best features of the Google Pixel 8 are:1: One of the best cameras in the market. On top of being a great camera, any imperfections in photos are fixed by Google's AI software.2: Amazing screen brightness & quality. The new OLED screen resolution and quality overall is one of the best I've seen in androids, definitely up there with the newest Galaxy S models. It can get very bright when you need it to and very dark.3: The design/durability. Google is well known for their unique phone designs, and the Pixel 8 is no exception. Anybody looking at the phone will know it's a Pixel. The back is also scratch resistant and can handle major falls. An added plus on top of its 7 year software updates!Where it falls short:1: It's G3 Tensor chip. Google has recently started developing their own phone chips, and the processing power in the G3 is good for a $600 phone. However, it unfortunately falls short of other flagship Samsung or Apple phones. It also tends to heat up a bit, but that's an added plus in winter time :)2: It's battery life. The battery is decent, lasting about 7 - 8 hours of heavy use, but is again outraced by Samsung.Overall, the phone is perfect in its camera quality, durability/design, and new OLED screen. However, it falls behind in its battery and G3 powering chip. Fixing these 2 issues would make it the perfect phone!

4.0,"Doesn't meet my expectations. 
I had a Google pixel 3a for 4 years. I absolutely loved that phone so when it came time for a new one phone I didn't hesitate to go with the pixel 8. I don't really feel the same about this newer version.  Some things I didn't like are: there is no back button, the swipe to return to the previous screen is clumsy and I find myself trying repeatedly to go back before it does. Sometimes I'm stuck and that is frustrating. The fingerprint sensor is not sensitive enough and I have to put my pin in often when I wake up the phone. I didn't know where the issue lies (with the phone or carrier) but every 3-4 days I have to reset the APN because all of the sudden I can no longer send texts to multiple recipients or include emojis or pictures. I'm assuming it's the phone since I had no trouble before the switch. I'm not super tech savvy but what I know is that I have problems that I didn't have before.  No, I wouldn't recommend it. If I could give a half star it would get a 3.5 ratingUPDATE: Biggest piece of junk. I've had this phone for 2.5 months and I have felt like throwing it as far as I can countless times. All of the issues above plus many times when I'm trying to login it WILL NOT give me a keyboard. The only way I've found to get past that is to power down and back up.  If you have a lot of extra time on your hands for these games, like a challenge and want to improve your pitching arm, go ahead and buy this phone.

5.0,"Great Phone That Is Easy To Set Up. 
I needed to switch to a cell phone that was compatible with some new hearing aids that I recently got.  I discovered that only a few brands and models would work with the new ASHE hearing aid compatibility standards.  This phone was on the approved list.  I did some research and found some very positive reviews on the Google Pixel phones so I purchased it from Amazon.  Shipping was super quick and the phone arrived new in the Google box with seals intact.  This phone has a huge battery that charges super quickly.  The phone copied everything from my old phone pretty much by itself with only a few button pushes.  It now looks almost exactly like my old phone setup and it copied almost all of the programs so everything was easy to find and use from the start.  This phone is super fast.

I had a fairly seamless set-up from my old LG phone. Everything was transferred to the new phone including all the apps which I was happy about. All was well for about a week and then realized the notification sound was not functioning. I went through all the usual steps to try and restore it myself. No luck with that so I engaged Google through the chat function. Very little wait time and the person that tried to fix the problem was very nice. However, she was unable to restore the sound for notifications. At that point I had two options: restore the phone to factory settings or return the phone. Unfortunately, by the time this all happened the price of the phone had gone up by $100 and I found that annoying. So, I restored the factory settings. Notification sound now worked! Yippee! Not quite. There was another problem in that I could no longer connect my phone to my laptop using phone link. Try as I might I couldn't fix it. The laptop would not make the bluetooth connection to the phone although it had previously done so. Both devices connected to other bluetooth items around the house.  I chatted with someone from Microsoft who insisted the problem was with the phone and not the laptop although I had my doubts. Not one to give up easily I contacted Google again via chat. This person asked to have remoted access to the desktop which I gave.  She then spent approximately two hours sorting out the source of the problem which lay in the registry of the laptop where there was a couple entries for the before factory restore Pixel 8. This, apparently, prevented bluetooth from finding the post factory restore Pixel 8 because it assumed it was already found. It took probably another hour to clean this up. And, finally, voila, the bluetooth was enabled and the connection to the phone worked.All of this time spent was really just trying to restore a little sound so that I would know when a text came through. In the end I don't know what exactly to say about Pixel 8. The service end of it was fine and the problem was eventually solved. I just hope it keeps working.A few days later I've decided to give it four stars instead of three stars. This is mainly because I was surprised at the customer support, the lack of wait time for ""chat"" function and the ultimate ability to resolve the issue. All components of the phone are still working fine.

4.0,"Phone is great. 
I upgraded from S22 ultraI feel this phone is smooth, camera is phenomenal and the HDR and night boost is amazing. It does take time to upload and process the videos but it's been great so far.The camera AI features are nice to have. Its hard to take good family pictures when going out sometimes so the face edit is neat , the only downside it works for 5 people at max. The AI size adjustments and moving stuff is nice but need to be precise so when moving objects, AI can properly fill the place behind itI've encountered some freezes at first but it stopped after the latest update.Battery is good, i never ran out of battery but i never tried going a full day out where i might need to charge, I also got a power bank that I can attach to the back of the phone with the magsafe case i got from dbrand , thats why i didn't complain about the battery. I only used the power bank when i forget to charge my phone at night.Screen brightness is really bright. At night it can be a flashbang if you're in your room with lights out, becareful of the auto brightness.AI features like summarize and call screening only works in the US? I ordered it to a frieght forwarder and shipped it overseas. The summarize and call screening doesnt work. Car keys and google VPN doesn't work either.Google gimini got introduced in a recent update, its the google version of chat GPT. It works well but sometimes it glitches out for example, I asked gimini "" show me the bullet train ticket prices from tokyo to kyoto "" . It showed me prices in JPY and I asked to convert to my local currency and he did, tried that again few days later and gmini apologize and said he can't do it.You can't have google assistant and gimini at the same time  when using shortcuts or the "" hey google "" . Sometimes im driving and i want to play a certain song but then i remember i have the gimini enabled and not assistant so i can't tell him to play the song because gimini answers questions and tasks are assistant's job.One con that really annoys me is the Bluetooth. Its weird. When i connect the phone to my car, sometimes it doesn't play the audio or the lag between audio and video is big, never had that in my s22 ultra. Also when playing music , my car screen always shows the song duration and name when using the S22 but on the pixel , it only shows the song title and no duration. Also there is a lag when displaying the song title.There is one tiny thing that i really liked is gesture control. You can double tap the back side of the phone to take screenshot or do a specific task, really cool. And the song auto detection is always welcomed. I once was watching a movie at home , the character was inCafe and the cafe had background music. The phone detected it and i was surprised.Thats is all what i can think of as of right now

4.0,"Phone is great. 
I upgraded from S22 ultraI feel this phone is smooth, camera is phenomenal and the HDR and night boost is amazing. It does take time to upload and process the videos but it's been great so far.The camera AI features are nice to have. Its hard to take good family pictures when going out sometimes so the face edit is neat , the only downside it works for 5 people at max. The AI size adjustments and moving stuff is nice but need to be precise so when moving objects, AI can properly fill the place behind itI've encountered some freezes at first but it stopped after the latest update.Battery is good, i never ran out of battery but i never tried going a full day out where i might need to charge, I also got a power bank that I can attach to the back of the phone with the magsafe case i got from dbrand , thats why i didn't complain about the battery. I only used the power bank when i forget to charge my phone at night.Screen brightness is really bright. At night it can be a flashbang if you're in your room with lights out, becareful of the auto brightness.AI features like summarize and call screening only works in the US? I ordered it to a frieght forwarder and shipped it overseas. The summarize and call screening doesnt work. Car keys and google VPN doesn't work either.Google gimini got introduced in a recent update, its the google version of chat GPT. It works well but sometimes it glitches out for example, I asked gimini "" show me the bullet train ticket prices from tokyo to kyoto "" . It showed me prices in JPY and I asked to convert to my local currency and he did, tried that again few days later and gmini apologize and said he can't do it.You can't have google assistant and gimini at the same time  when using shortcuts or the "" hey google "" . Sometimes im driving and i want to play a certain song but then i remember i have the gimini enabled and not assistant so i can't tell him to play the song because gimini answers questions and tasks are assistant's job.One con that really annoys me is the Bluetooth.

Honestly, I really like the phone. Way better camera than my old but high-end Samsung, and without all the bloatware. And I'm delighted to be free of the crap that Verizon puts on their phones. Battery life is great. I really can run all day without plugging in the changer, and often have 40% or more left when I climb into bed. My only complaint is that some of the common gesture functions, especially changing apps. My fingers are big, and I've yet to be able to swipe up to change apps reliably, often accidently opening search or app tray instead. Wish there were a more reliable alternate way to do this for people with clumsy fingers.

The user interface is minimalist and excellent, with no bloatware, but I do miss some features like an app vault. However, the phone tends to heat up significantly even after all updates. Additionally, some features are exclusive to the Pro version, like the Google Assistant for screening spam calls, which feels unnecessary and could easily be included in the standard model. The standout feature of this phone is undoubtedly the camera's post-processing capabilities, which are top-notch.

3.0,"My worst purchase in 5 years. 
This post is about disappointment. Below, I will describe all the problems I faced in a month (a little more) of using the Google Pixel 8 PRO with 256 gigabytes.I'll try my best not to be bitter, but I'm not sure if I'll succeed because I expected something completely different from a $1050 phone.I bought the US version on Amazon. As a pre-order gift with the phone, they offered the Google Pixel Watch 2. In total, all this pleasure cost me $1050. I wasn't particularly interested in the watch and planned to sell them, thereby reducing the overall cost of the phone. In fact, currently on ""Black Friday,"" the phone on the official website costs $859. So, there was no gift in the form of the watch, and I paid for the phone + watch.I consider $350 for the Google Pixel Watch 2 an absurd price because there are many cool watches on the market cheaper.Let's start with the most important: Calls. In ""vibration"" mode, there is no audible notification in TWS headphones. The call volume in the headphones is tied to the ""ring volume"" in the ""sound and vibration"" section. Before switching to the Google Pixel 8 Pro, I always used the vibrate mode, and I could hear all incoming calls in the headphones. For people who talk a lot on the phone, this will be a very unpleasant moment. This problem extends to all non-Google TWS headsets. Next, take Pixel Buds Pro, connect them to the phone, and encounter the following problem: the audio notifications during incoming calls work only the first 3-4 times, then disappear. You need to disconnect the headset and reconnect it.The side buttons are not tactile.Weak processor. In synthetic tests, the processor delivers 1K. I consider this a very low indicator for a phone that positions itself as a flagship. Currently, it doesn't feel noticeable, but the fact remains. There are Chinese brands that have Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. There, the performance is approximately twice as much. If you are taking a phone for a long time, such a performance indicator is not great.Accessories. No charger and SIM ejector tool. SIM ejector tool, seriously. I opened the SIM card slot with a needle and a door frame catch. I just have no words, only emotions.Battery life. The phone is new and lasts for now. My Xiaomi, which I used for 3 years, held up about the same. If you look at reviews comparing battery life with other phones, it's all sad there.Charging time. My previous Xiaomi phone, bought in 2018, had a 38W charger. Besides being included in the package, it also charged faster.Raw operating system. Approximately 2-3 times a week, I reboot the phone. The notification shade doesn't come down, the button doesn't respond, black screen during incoming calls, and there are just tons of such bugs. To understand how tragic everything is, you need a month with this phone.Rattling. If you shake the phone, you can hear the optics (lens) hitting the phone's body. And this problem is not only on my phone. A friend has the same issue.Speaker sound. It's not bad, but on the iPhone, it's better. More midrange and low frequencies.Wi-Fi problems. Doesn't always want to connect to the access point. No matter what Wi-Fi standard it operates on or the authentication method on the access point. It might disconnect from the access point, might say the password is incorrect. A friend has the same issue. This problem was detected on Mikrotik access points.Well, there are a bunch of downsides, but now I can't remember them.Well, and I want to highlight a couple of positives so it's not all that tragic.Camera. Beautiful photos, very good in night mode. Magic erase is a cool thing. It doesn't always work 100%, but sometimes it really surprises with what AI can do.Conclusion: Before switching to the Google Pixel 8 Pro, I had the Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G. I bought it for $260. For that money, I got an excellent phone that worked flawlessly for 3 years. MIUI shell, in my opinion, is much better than this Android on the Pixel.I'll probably sell the phone. Even if all the software problems are fixed, the impression of the phone is not very good anymore, and I don't want to use it.

Lots of reviews on the Pixel 8. By now you're either probably going to buy one or not. But I'll add my two cents worth. First off it is a Google Pixel. Not a lot of big changes from previous Pixels. I don't know why all the negative reviews. It worked great right out of the box. I'm coming from a Pixel 4. Yes there are improvements and more customizations in some areas. The camera especially is improved. It flat out takes great pics for a base phone at this price level. I like the size. Slightly bigger than my old 4, but still slips into and out of my pockets easily. They moved the finger print reader to the front and frankly it sucks. I keep re-teaching the reader and it works well for a while and then craps out to working only half the time. Yes I use a glass display protector. And a nice Crave case. You are foolish not to. For my usage,[no games or heavy social media], the battery is adequate. Not great but it adapts after several charges to your usage. The big plus for me is the 7 years of updates. I tend to hang onto my phones as long as possible. I believe the state of technology is slowing down and this phone should last a while. Yes you can spend a thousand dollars plus, but I got this phone on a spring sale deal and I think it is a good new base Google phone.

I upgraded from the pixel 7, first month i had great experience, i didnt even switch screen resolution to Full - Highest mode, because i was worried it would effect already a hot phone even getting hotter, so my experience is with 1080p, so phone is super toasty like all the pixels of course, it has terrible LTE/5G modem (on wifi it works noticably cooler and longer), it drains SO MUCH BATTERY, that im charging my phone 2 times a day,( i use 4G 24hr/7 , because i have unlimited of it, so it's easier rather then switching to wifi back and forth) startng off with 100% 7:00, second cycle is at around 12-1 when it gets down to 20% and then the last at midnight or before the sleep, depends what i plan to do, but if i have to go out of course i should charge it with super slow charging brick, which wasn't even included in the box. so to make it short, i still love the phone especially after my problem with  hating on the Pixel overprocessed photos got solved with the new manual mode+raw, only stuff to improve is efficiency, makephone cooler(bc when it gets hot it's making experience super unpleasant, its like scrolling through the menu with a 2 y.o. samsung flagship that is having micro lags everywhere, lol ) with a great battery, plus would love to see higher wattage charging support such as 50w+ , and also if you love to play some graphically intensive games, this thing handles ok, but not in the terms of ""very well"" .Now the good part i really loved after switching from the 7 is the MUCH brighter screen , better ultrawide and a telephoto lens, which is pretty good! for me this  things were such a deal breakers that i decided to upgrade from it.There is no perfect phone 🤷‍

Pixel doesn't have a dedicated music player. I actually had to buy a music player app from playstore just to have a music player. In Samsung, you can screenshot the entire page by scrolling down. This one, sometimes it works on other page, sometimes it doesn't. And the magic eraser, Samsung's magiic eraser works better. One day, my videos started stuttering on pixel 8. I decided to uninstall Google photos app thinking it just needs to be reinstalled only to find out that the cause of the stuttering is because I was using a Bluetooth headphone. Seriously, my S20 FE never had that problem, but this one does. Unless they fix all of these annoyances, I will never buy a pixel phone ever again. But I'm keeping this one because of the 7 years of support.

To be honest, this really is an excellent phone. However, after 5 months I have not bonded with it emotionally and don't believe I ever will. I'm sure that the notion of forging an emotional bond with a phone might be not be readily understandable to some. I think, maybe, you have to experience this to understand. This phone is a remarkable piece of technology. Everything from the design to the AI functions is absolutely top notch. And the camera? It is astonishingly good. The issue I have with this phone is that it's, well, it's just cold. And clinical. For the longest time I used, and continue to use, a Samsung Galaxy S8. The Galaxy is now my second phone and the Pixel my daily blower. I am, in fact, a long-time Galaxy user, having started with the S2. The Galaxies are excellent phones that just got too pricey for me. I didn't really want to replace my treasured S8 but it was 5 years old and, while still fully functional, was slowing down quite a bit. The Pixel was really my only option as I hate iOS devices with a passion. Love my Macs but those iPads and iPhones are just awful. I bought the Pixel 8 and got the Pixel Buds Pro packaged along with them. If they are still doing a package deal on these, skip the Buds. Their features are great but the audio really stinks. Anyway, if you're looking for a cutting edge, affordable cellphone, and you don't care if you become emotionally attached to it or not, the Pixel 8 is a superior option.

4.0,"Amazing camera with AI aid,but lacking battery. 
This smartphone feels amazing in hands and coming from a 6.55"" block, it is like a day and night in weight and size. It fits very well my pockets. The screen is pretty smooth, Pixel UI is very clean and minimalistic, without all the nonsense and infinite options that characterize chinese Ui like Miui or ColorOs. Color otherwise is kind of dull, not vivid and there isn't too much options to change. Camera is Amazing and I see why Pixels compete hand to hand with Iphone; my device basically saved our Christmas diner photo since the Iphone couldn't so much back lighting while the Pixel got an outstanding photo with just one click. Everything feels smooth, especially at 120 Hz but even at 60, it feels greats. Google photo AI editor, magic eraser and noise eraser are amazing tools, I could even use magic editor to erase some numbers from an image for a University project. Now the bad parts about this phone: Chip isn't the most efficient, sometimes it even gets hot easily with minimal tasks, and even worse when using LTE (not 5g since in my country that technology isn't working). I can easily see the difference in battery health when using data instead wifi. without battery saver,this device will lasts like 4 or 5 hours. It is so underwhelming since this is the only way to e joy the 120 Hz refresh rate. With battery saver, things get better and you can accomplish like 6 to 8 hours, but by dimming the phone capabilities.finally the worst part of this phone is the lacking 27w to charge which basically take between 1.5 hours to 2. It is so disappointing that a 2023 Smartphone charges so slowly and with a horrible barrery management your battery depletes like water ins hands. Just to look at the screen You've already lost 1%. So I would recommended this device just to people who prioritizes camera over battery and performance and those who can live with a charger 24/7 (charger not included 🥴).

I bought this as a gift, so it's been somewhat stressful first day.It does feel and look good. UI very responsive.It took forever to sync from old phone. Installing and setting up old apps took forever.My migration from a Nokia 8 Sirocco (Android One), to Xiaomi 11T Pro a couple of years ago was FAR faster and smoother.I wanted pure android and a good Android One phone is nonexistent anymore.From unboxing and first power on it was advising there was dirt or moisture in the USB port.The camera is good, but does not seem to save every snap. Would take several pictures and some did not seem to save.The finger print reader almost always requires a second attempt to unlock. Using a pin requires hitting enter to submit. Previous phones never required this extra input.The most concerning point - It would not charge over night. I woke at 4am to find the phone had not progressed past 10%. Had to power off device to initiate charging and then power back on. Once rebooted it would detect the power cable being connected / disconnected a couple times and start charging. This was after a system update was performed. I'll try disable adaptive charging if it happens again. If this persists it may need to be returned.Battery only really lasts a day, I'd expect closer to two, if not more like my 11T.We'll see how day 2 goes ... Started the day with a message saying the phone was 0 days old and required a security update.So far not overly impressed, especially with this being a Google product.Follow up review:After a week it has grown on the person I have bought it for. Intuitive UI and easy to use.The biggest failing point is the battery and really slow charging. Struggles to last a full day. Coming from a near 4-5 year old phone that still allows you to skip a day and charges significantly faster.The person does not like charging over night and has still not gotten used to it. These big brand ""premium"" phones need to adopt 90 or 120W charging. It's pure and utter freedom and peace of mind. Zero stress life. But then they'd need to package an included charging brick ...Tl;Dr - would not buy product line again unless much faster charging technology adopted.

5.0,"Great Mid-Range Phone With a Superb Camera!. 
I did a LOT of research on the latest Android smartphones before settling on one that had the best features for my budget.  I REFUSE to pay $1000 or more for a quality smartphone; with that being said, I've had my share of cheap, low-budget smartphones, and you literally get what you pay for when you opt for an inexpensive budget smartphone:  Hiccups and glitches galore.  This time around, I decided to ""upgrade"" and get a phone that would last for more than two years without making me want to chuck it across the room every time it froze or glitched.  I think the Google Pixel 8 phone will be one I will hold on to for a while, provided I don't drop it hard enough to destroy it as I've done a couple of times with my low-budget phones, lol!  Not only do I like the look, features, and quality of the Google Pixel 8, I absolutely LOVE the fact that it's a fairly small phone, as smartphones go.  I have small hands and didn't want a large phone that is more difficult to hold on to while using, AND Pixel 8 fits comfortably in my pockets or a small purse. I also take a LOT of pics, and Google Pixel 8 has one of the best cameras around. Of course, price was indeed an issue for me, and I wanted a high quality phone without the high quality price--the Pixel 8 fits the bill perfectly.  Although its cousin, the Pixel 8 Pro, is rated higher and has an even better camera, that extra ""high quality"" comes with a heftier price tag as well.  Even though the Pixel 8 Pro is also priced below $1000, it's still more than I was willing to pay at this point.  I opted for the less expensive Pixel 8 (around $500) and thus far, I am very satisfied with my purchase. With the YEARS of updates promised, the mid-range price, and smaller size, I believe I've made a good investment.  Hopefully, I will still feel the same beyond two years from now.  So far, I recommend!!

The Google Pixel 8's a solid phone, being loaded with smart AI tools and features like call screening. Camera is solid, as expected with the Pixel line of phones, and you get a 6 month free trial of Google One, with 2 TB of storage. Build quality is good, although the glass isn't matte like the Pixel 8 Pro. The speakers are very loud, and the screen is bright and visible in the sun.The fingerprint reader is very accurate, albeit a little slow compared to other readers. The face recognition is also good, to where you can use it to unlock banking apps and such, although taking off my glasses or dimming the lights causes it to not recognize me. It holds up very well though, with it staying locked when I held a picture of my face up to the camera.Out of the box, the battery drain is terrible on 5G UC (T-Mobile), to the point where it even impacted my charge times heavily. Change this to LTE, and the phone easily lasts you throughout the whole day, with around 6-8 hours of screen on time, even with the 120 hz refresh rate enabled. Turning off or limiting the always on display also helps in this case, since the Pixel 8 does not have an LTPO display like the Pixel 8 Pro, it only has a variable refresh rate display which goes from 120 to 60 hz.I haven't had any problems with the software, other than a hiccup when I first setup the phone, and it has stayed smooth and reliable throughout my week or so of use.When I purchased this phone, it also came with Pixel Buds Pro for free, although they unfortunately don't create a very good seal in my ears, no matter what ear tips I chose.

Negatives noted after couple weeks use: battery life is mediocre at best and will be run down in less than a day of very heavy use. The back gets pretty hot in use, which also suggests that the processor suffers from the same high heating issues and possible lower efficiency as previous model when compared to Qualcomm Snapdragon 8. I HATE that the camera doesn't have manual focus, especially for macro - i specifically got it because of that mode and it's basically near impossible to use or nail focus. Macro mode also cuts the image right down in size, making it appear to be doing more magnification but actually just digital zooming, and unfortunately the raw file is also cut down. The Jpegs are ridiculously oversharpened and when you look at the raw image the image is really not great - very soft and blurry - apparently even when focus is correct. And when you use another app camera that does have manual focus (like Lightroom), the close focus mode is not available. It seems ridiculous and frustrating that the Pixel 8 does not get the camera app Pro Controls option that the 8 Pro has - this is just software difference to  help justify price difference, and it REALLY limits the otherwise excellent main camera of the pixel 8. There seems to be no way to adjust auto jpg sharpening and colour, and the results are way overcooked for my taste - oversharpened and over-saturated.

2.0,"Over rated, major oversight-no message reminders. 
Pixel 8 pro, flagship, top phone, best of there best and Google has chosen to omit message reminders from this phone. I had spent a lot of time trying to find this feature through the vast amount of settings options. 3 support chat attempts, one request for a phone call which I didn't receive. Last chat person confirmed what I suspected, some morons omitted this feature. This is cell phone basics. So if you miss a call or text you won't know it until you pick up your phone and have a look. And take a good look. The dots on the app icons are small showing you there is a call-text for you.  To me this is a big deal since I don't care to have a phone on my body at all times. With this basic mode being ommited I have to wonder what other ilogical choices have these developers made. I do like that the phone can be set to flash when receiving the initial call or text, but that's all you get. Phone functions fine otherwise. Can't say I was blown away. Coming from an old, outdated, Samsung 8 active. I had no issues with Samsung just thought I would give this a try. The camera on this phone is wildly over rated. It's good but with all the hype I was expecting to say wow. In fact I said that's it. My old phone must have been leap years ahead of its time.  Battery life is fine for me. Pandora will run on my phone most days all day. No a huge battery drain there but it's not better than my old dated phone. And I decided to replace that phone because the battery is showing the signs of its age. If this is on par with my old phone now, what will this phone be like I in 5-6 years... I knew I would not be crazy about the camera lens bump and ya I am not, at all. I went with this phone for the photo editing. Reviews put it a bit more user friendly than s24. Again not impressed. And since I was directed by this phone to a 3rd party app, what's the point. Finger print reader is nothing more than annoying once a screen protector goes on. Really like the speed at which the phone powers up. Charges fast with a faster charging block. Had to buy that since it doesn't come with a charging block. Not a big deal to me. Everyone should have charges around by now. Not a fan of the key board. No long press for a dual purpose letter. Such as letter sharing a symbol of you press and hold to get the symbol. So many setting I don't know what a lot of it is for. That maybe the norm these days. Long story short, good chance I will send this back. I am completely hung up on how dumb are the developers to get ride of message reminders, which I guess Google calls Nudges, and concerned about long term battery life.

Switched from a Samsung S20FE to the Pixel 8 Pro, 256GB (unlocked). Menues and swipes are a bit different but the transition has not been bad. No issues swapping SIM card with Xfinity service. Data transfer was easy and done wirelessly. The screen is great and camera is top notch, but the camera does protrude from the back about 1/8"" for the lenses. Finger print reader has been good and better than the Samsung which constantly got stuck in touch protection mode. The battery life is so-so for the price, but I have not used the battery optimization yet. It does seem to charge faster than the S20. Still adapting to an all-Google way, so not sure if there is some mild bugginess or user error or both. I also have a '22 Volvo with Google controls. The Pixel seems to interface better with the car than the S20, but I'm still working on getting that all dialed in. I do wish the Pixel had expandable memory. Im guessing the hi-res camera and video can eat up 256GB pretty quicky. I'm sure Google will be happy to store my stuff in the cloud, for yet another small montly fee in my life.

I've been waiting a long time since the Pixel 5's release to buy a new Pixel device.Good things:The camera is much better than in the Pixel 5, but it produces cooler tones. It seems like it needs more precise adjustments to match reality more closely. I want the colors in the photos to be exactly as I see them with my eyes.The promise of 7 years of updates and parts availability is impressive.Bad things:To my surprise, the screen uses PWM, as clearly shown by the pencil test. I really wish for the return of IPS screens. Honestly, these AMOLED screens have inferior contrast and suffer from PWM. My old LG G6 had a much better screen with better contrast and easier-to-read text.It's good that it's smaller than the 6-7 series, but it's still larger, which is a drawback. Why can't Google maintain the same size as iPhone and Samsung phones? Hey Google, people are buying their phones, just follow their lead – it's not that daunting.The small, rounded screen edges are a concern. I'd like to buy a screen protector that doesn’t require UV glue. Could you make screens as flat as possible?BUGS: I use the 3-button navigation style, and the ""recent apps"" button stops working after a while. This issue occurs on both the Pixel 5 and Pixel 8 devices with the latest Android 14 + patches.

Heads up that I am posting this review a fourth time after it was removed by Amazon.  This could mean that the seller is attempting to remove bad reviews of this phone, but I cannot be sure.  Here is the email I received:""Thank you for submitting a review of Google Pixel 8 Pro - Unlocked Android Smartphone with Telephoto Lens and Super Actua Display - 24-Hour Battery - Bay - 512 GB; we are sorry you did not have a positive experience. We investigated your concerns about product authenticity, and the information we have indicates that the product you received was authentic. As a result, we removed the review you submitted. This ensures that customer reviews remain as accurate as possible for the benefit of future customers.""The color range and depth of the Pixel 8 Pro is remarkably bad.  I have seen better screens on $200 phones, and I'm not making knee-jerk exaggerations about it.  I really want to love this phone, and I do love most other aspects of it.  But for some reason, Google decided to put a screen on it that's so bad, I wouldn't trust that I'm taking good photos until I saw them on another phone or a computer display.I understand that this is a bold claim, so let me prove what I'm saying in photos.  In each photo, the Pixel 8 Pro is on the left, and a OnePlus 7t is on the right, both at 100% brightness.  The photos were taken with a OnePlus 8t.  Keep in mind that these are photos of screens, and cameras aren't fully representative of what we see.  Additionally, screens emit some light that gets picked up by cameras that we cannot see, and you (the reader) are looking at these photos through yet another screen.  Regardless, I believe that these photos do a satisfactory job of displaying the the poor color range of the 8 Pro.I included three photos of a website displaying pure primary colors (red, green, and blue), and included one more photo of an image that displays a range of colors.  Both of these phones use OLED displays, so the ""red"" areas contain pixels where only the red subpixels are at 100% brightness, while the blue and green subpixels are fully off, for example.  I verified this on both devices firsthand with a jeweler's loupe, just to be sure.  Primary colors are supposed to be ""pure"" colors, meaning that the ""red"" photo is the phone attempting to produce the most ""red"" color it can, for example.I really don't need to explain much more, since the photos deliver some pretty solid justice.  Notice that the red especially looks like tomato paste on the Pixel 8 Pro while they look like ""pure red"" on the 7t.  And the blues and greens of a ""good"" OLED screen almost look ""fake"" from so much color, but again, this is with the primary subpixels of their respective color on full brightness, so the ""redder"" the red is, the better the color depth of the red is.  Additionally, dark colors on the 8 Pro are much too bright and washed out.Needless to say, it's lousy.  What was Google thinking?  I am so disappointed in the screen, that I'm returning the phone on this basis alone.  I am distracted by the screen quality anytime I use the phone for any occasion.  Returning to my 7t feels like a breath of fresh air.  This screen simply should not be sold on a ~$1k device.

I upgraded to this phone from my Samsung s10e. I was in between this s24 and the pixel 8 during my research.

After using it for a couple of months, I definitely do not regret the purchase. The camera quality, battery life, and the software experience are all ideal. I usually end the day with around 30% of battery remaining. While the phone does sometimes get warm, every phone brand also gets warm after some usage. The 120hz screen also feels very smooth. Yes, in terms of hardware and benchmark results it's not the highest, but in real life usage the overall experience isn't noticeable at all and sometimes I feel like it's a marketing tactic from other brands.

Initially I had trouble with the Wi-Fi, constantly connecting, disconnecting and then not wanting to connect. I discovered that the phone has an issue connecting to Wi-Fi access that are configured 160 MHz wide channels. After reconfiguring my access point to an 80 MHz wide channel the Wi-Fi has worked perfectly. Initially I also had trouble with gestures and had to figure out how to turn on the triangle circle square buttons at the bottom of the screen. I did not find gestures very intuitive or the feature wasn't working as advertised. The battery life is excellent. Much better than my previous Pixel 4XL, I would say about double the life. I need to play around a bit more with the camera to see how well the camera works. The photos I've taken so far have looked very good. Overall I have been pleased with the phone other than the initial issues with the Wi-Fi, which I hope Google resolves with a future update, and my troubles with gestures.

Picked up this Pixel 8 phone for $749, and it included a bundled pair of Pixel Pro earbuds for that price. (Yes, you can get the phone cheaper now, but my old phone was dying).  Considering this thing is 1/2 the price of an iPhone (or less), it's a terrific deal. The camera is amazing. The AI features are crazy.  I love Google Search, being able to draw a circle around anything on the screen and do a search on it. Battery life is VERY good.  TikTok, Instagram, FB, etc. don't seem to make a huge dent. Good 5G reception on T Mobile network, fast wifi speeds. I use my phone as a WiFi hotspot in our RV all the time, and the Pixel 8 provides good connectivity and WiFi speed for a Roku, iPad, etc. when we're on the road.  Regular OS updates have been coming out close together with new features, too.  And works great with my Google ecosystem (Chrome, Nest, Home, etc.).  Fingerprint reader in-screen is a little finicky if your finger is wet/damp, or very cold.  That's my only real complaint. I got the 256gb model because T Mobile only offered the 128gb phone at the T Mobile store/website.  Thanks for a great deal on a great phone, Amazon!

Bought this to get the latest cellular modem devices, as well as the extended security update support. I also wanted a newer phone with better battery capacity. I also purchased an Otterbox case. My service is Boost Infinite.I upgraded from an unlocked Pixel 4a5g to the Pixel 8 128GB.Pros:- Seamless transfer from my Pixel 4a5g via wifi.- Seamless transfer of service via SIM transfer from Pixel 4a5g, using the Boost app.- Gets 5G UC in North SF Bay Area. 5G is working fine in more densely populated areas.- Battery life is good, without battery saver. I do not game or watch tons of videos.- Front fingerprint reader works well with left or right thumb, so I find that I don't miss the rear fingerprint reader on the 4a5g.Cons:- Battery saver shuts off 5G. However, 4G LTE is very adequate at around 180 MbpS in my service area.- Larger battery and/or camera update means Google had to make the camera protrude from the back.- This device may feel too heavy and thick for some.

I got this to replace my 7 pro. I love it. The physical look and design are beautiful. Matte back, and the Google emblem is a different texture. Super speedy, and even though the screen is the same size as the 7 pro, you can see more as they extended the screen a bit more to the edges. It threw me off because I transferred all settings over from my 7 pro, and the font was a tiny bit larger than it was on the 7. No issues with battery life thus far.Really lightweight and sleek, just note that it's very top heavy because of the camera. Which brings me to my favorite part....The camera is phenomenal. Before even opening the camera, I could tell it was quality. Just looking at the external lenses makes my inner photographer so happy. Long exposure and night sight both work great. Can't wait to see all the amazing moments I capture! I'm a hiker that makes online content, so being able to snap such crisp and realistic photos is super important for me. This phone delivers!I can't wait for the 9!!

Phone itself is probably the best cost to performance phone on the market. It does everything a modern phone needs to do: has a great camera, reasonable battery, thumbprint and face unlock, awesome display, large storage capacity. For the price it doesn't really get better.I was specifically worried about the refurbished quality. Instead of rolling the dice I opted for the slightly more expensive option ""like new"" instead of ""good"". It arrived in slightly beat up packaging that might not be worthy for display on the shelf, but otherwise everything in the box was included like it was a brand new phone. Zero cosmetic damage to the screen or case body. Functions perfectly. Was unlocked like stated in the listing and I was able to change my sim card from an iphone without going in to the store.I will update if I run into any other problems, but from now I will be more trusting of Amazon refurbished products wouldn't be afraid to buy good quality, but still feel it's risky on big purchases to go any worse than that. 1 star for face recognition because I haven't tried it yet.

March 2024 update: Most software kinks worked out at this point, phone still feels fantastic to use. Definitely not the best battery life or most efficient processor, however it's still very fast and usable for everything, gaming included. Cameras really are spectacular - everyone I talk to loves the pictures I take with this phone. Good image processing too. List of pixel exclusive features keeps growing, definitely worth it for those.Idk what other people are doing when they are having issues getting their carrier to register on their phone - for me it took about 5 seconds during the setup process after transferring my SIM from my pixel 6 to the 8 pro, and it was all set.Phone is less of a toaster than my pixel 6, better cameras, feels faster - ill get back to this in a moment - better screen, lots of really cool software features that are worth spending the time to learn about.Does it actually feel faster? 100% yes - however you should remember that this is a brand new phone, and depending on what data you transfer over, it's going to take some time to ""relearn"" or recache your habits and such, so certain things are gonna load a little slow at first, but speed up a lot over time - this is expected behavior. Also keep in mind since it's still new, there are some bugs here and there that software updates will work out over time. I noticed a couple, nothing that majorly impacts my usage though.Overall, fantastic phone, really easy setup - esp if you had a pixel prior - I really like the shade of blue they used as well for the pro, good case choice can compliment it quite nicely. I do kind of wish the titanium was less shiny, but its not a big deal for me.

5.0,"Awesome device - got on sale.. 
Super smart device, has some extremely intuitive features and simplifies things for you in many ways. I've always used Samsung, so coming from this I was a little nervous, but after you get the hang of the gestures and stuff, it's SUPER cohesive and fluid. The search functions, summarization capabilities, AI tech, etc are all great. Battery life is pretty good as well, nothing to complain about from me. It'll last, from full charge, for about a day and some change with moderate use.And that camera.. WOW. The camera itself is already amazing, but they basically process it right after you take it with AI to sharpen and enhance it, and it makes for some of the best pictures I've ever seen come from a smartphone. It has this thing called the magic editor, which let's you use some AI tools to make adjustments to images, and that's absolutely mind-blowing to use.All around an awesome phone. I DID get it on sale for about $500, but I still think if you're able to afford it, this is a great choice.

So far I'm enjoying the phone. It takes excellent pictures and the camera app opens so fast. Much better than the s22u I came from, so I'm very happy about that. My only problem is the ram management isn't the best, it keeps closing my apps. I wish there was an option like Samsung to use some of the ssd as ram. Battery life is better than the s22u I came from and it looks great too. I also love the fingerprint sensor as it's more snappy and and actually works vs my Samsung.

2.0,"Disappointing. 
I admittedly didn't do much research before buying this phone, but I've been quite disappointed.  I previously had a Moto X4 with Android 9 but wanted a phone with esim capability for a trip I was taking.  I've been using this phone for about 2 weeks now and the only two new features I've found helpful are the esim capability and when receiving a call being able to send it to an automated assistant (I haven't actually had a use for it yet, but it does seem like it could be really handy to find out what a call is about while occupied in a meeting).  Everything else has pretty much been a disappointment.When setting up the phone it was supposed to be copying my settings from my previous phone.  I'm not sure what copied, but it didn't copy many useful settings, it didn't copy any apps,After setting up the apps I typically use, they didn't work as well on this phone as they did on the 5 year old Moto X4.  When I open Google Maps, it won't let me type in to search for something.  It has a voice option, but never opens a keyboard.  When I receive email messages they often show up as separate notifications for 1 email message each instead of showing one notification that there are 3 new email messages (all the email messages are received in the same account).  When playing music in my car with a bluetooth connection, the old Moto X4 would display the song title, artist, etc on the car display; the new phone plays music, but apparently doesn't support sending that additional information.In addition, the defaults for the phone seem to be trying to imitate an iPhone which I find obnoxious.  If I wanted an iPhone interface I would have bought one of those.  I also found it very disappointing there is no headphone jack or slot for an additional memory card.So overall I've been very disappointed with this phone and would not recommend it.  I'll likely go back to my Moto X4 and see if I can get a few more years out of it.

3.0,"Upgrade. 
It's an upgrade over the old phone I had. More tech and bells and whistles which is good in a way but in others not so much. Thought I'd give google a try. Don't like that it transcribes everything that's said and is very annoying when your texting and your text also includes what's being said around you.  Don't have a person to provide answers on how to stop this.No customer service.  Found out on my own to turn the microphone off whenever I need to text. Then in the middle of  texting I get a phone call and have to turn the microphone back on. Hate to know Big Brother is listening.  I'll definitely go back to Samsung in the future.

I bought this phone and thought long and hard about keeping it.  I shouldn't have.  In the short time I've had it the battery has started running down in a day.  Sometimes it doesn't charge.  The heat is terrible, I can feel the heat really hot in my hand, and I have to let it cool down before I can use it or recharge.  I'm so disappointed because I paid for something that doesn't deliver.  I'm probably going to be forced to buy a replacement, but it won't be this kind. Not sure how it can last long with the heat. I'm like so many people who can't afford to keep spending money on an inferior product.

I upgraded from the Pixel 6. Aside from the enhanced zoom and magic editor it doesn't feel that much better. Yes, the zoom is awesome, and so is the editor. But, for my purposes, this doesn't feel like enough of a leap forward to merit the 'upgrade'. Don't get me wrong, it's a great phone, but you've got a Pixel 6 or 7, and don't need the 30x zoom or magic editor, it might be worth waiting to see what comes next.

So far the phone has been working well. I purchased it because of how long it's going to receive Android upgrades and security updates. This allowed me to justify the price. The camera works well for both video and still images. I'm a light phone user, so hopefully this phone lasts for all the years it receives software updates. If so, it will have been worth it.
