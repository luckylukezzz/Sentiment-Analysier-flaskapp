5.0,"Excellent budget gaming keyboard and mouse combo. 
Nice combo. Keyboard is organized nicely, good ergonomics, backlighting is very nice... all good! Yes, it's a membrane keyboard but it's virtually silent and I have had zero misfires... accuates well. The mouse is accurate, fits my hand nicely, programmable buttons, lights are fine, I like the weight management... works great. My only gripe was how difficult it was to find a working, and proper software link, for the mouse. That was a needless chase because it's not listed in the instructions and the 'obvious' link on the Redrangon website doesn't link you to the correct software. Link fiasco aside, it's a nice budget package.

5.0,"You cannot get a better keyboard and mouse combo in this price range, I am certain of it.. 
Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the ""you get what you pay for"" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange ""tall"" type that relocates the ""\"" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. ""#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?"" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... ""What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return"". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice.

4.0,"A Great Keyboard, but.... 
Important Update: The ""new"" ROG Strix Scrope II 98 Wireless Keyboard uses a new 2.4 GHz technology called SpeedNova via the new USB Omni Receiver. This keyboard became available in early July, 2023. This means that mice/ devices that were manufactured prior to 2022 are not compatible, and will not pair to the a to the ROG Omni Receiver. Asus is working diligently on updating their Armoury Crate software to provide the newest of drivers upon connection of each device. I believe that new devices that support this technology should have the logo on their box. (please see attached photo).The ROG Stix Scope II 96 Wireless Gaming keyboard has a nice heavy physical feel. The Snow (Refined linear switches) provides a solid and clean sound, with “thocky” acoustics, which is pleasing to the ear. Even though constructed mainly of plastic, the keyboard has acquired an impressive appearance.Tri-Mode Connectivity/ ROG Omni Receiver:I enjoy the fact that Asus has given the End User the opportunity to choose what type of connectivity they desire (Wired, Bluetooth, or RF 2.4GHz.)RGB Lighting:The lightning could be a tad brighter when set to 100 percent. I know, if you want to save on battery power, set the lighting at 50 percent. Should I choose the wired connection is not as bright as the rest of my system. Which brings up a new topic, Aura Sync. When in Bluetooth mode, you are unable to sync your color settings. This would explain the necessity to use factory attribute presets. Should you turn off the LEDs, the letters on the keys are barely visible.There is a problem with pairing a mouse to the ROG Omni Receiver (Firmware update established and installed.) I must have tried a half a dozen times, and simply could not get the mouse to pair up to the Omni receiver. After a few phone calls to ASUS, and had gotten no where. I decided to join one the ROG blogs pertaining to this issue. I found it to be more productive than calling ASUS technical support. I learned that any devices that are to connect to the Omni receiver need to be SpeedNova compliant. This means devices manufactured late 2022 into 2023. Apparently, I am not alone, other users have encountered the same connectivity issue. I contacted the Product Manager and explained the problem. I asked for a parts compatibility list for this new Omni receiver. Never got one.

5.0,"LOVE. 
I needed a new keyboard for work since I do have acrylic nails and the keyboard they give us is so hard to use, so after reading some of the other reviews I went with this one. And I’m so glad I did! The colors are bright, the keyboard keys are soft touch and don’t make too much clicking noise. The mouse is perfect for my hand and I love that you can customize the mouse settings for scrolling and movement. It’s relatively easy to clean and is durable for sure. The only con I have is that I wish the mouse would change colors with the keyboard but it stays red, which is definitely not a deal breaker for me. I’m about to order another one for my home computer

Ive been gaming for years and have gone thru several keyboards, some very expensive. This keyboard is the best. Very responsive. The keys are the perfect size. Not mechanical but you wouldn't know as the keys are so responsive. I absolutely recommend.

I purchased this mouse and keyboard set for my grandson's first gaming PC build.  It looks and works great!  There is software for the mouse that allows you to create macros, repeat keys, etc.  This worked out great for his games.  He loves it!

4.0,"Could have been better. 
For those that really don't like a lot of feel while typing this is a good keyboard.  In fact, it would be inappropriate to say under any circumstances, that it was less than a good keyboard.  So what is wrong?  First of all, the keys ""feel"" closer together, so I find I am having to relearn how to use a keyboard.  Second, unless you have a very well lit room, you have to have the keyboard lit up as the key top printing is so dark, you can't really see the letters, etc., on the key facings.  And you have to have the brightness all the way up.And then there is the mouse.  For a strictly right handed user, the buttons on the side of the mouse are probably fine, but they are a nuisance for a left handed user.  IF they could be just turned off, that would be far better, but the very limited ""manual"" only covers changing the DPI setting.  It says you can make changes through the software after downloading and installing it but fails to tell you where to download it from.  It's not in the manual, so I will have to use a search to find the company's website.  Ooops, it's on the box, not that it matters, really, since there is no . It will be interesting to see if the ""software"" is in any other form other than for Windows.  I dual boot with Windows and Linux, so I am hoping that there is also Linux software support.  Nope, Windows only.  Figures.

4.0,"Great keyboard, not so good mouse.. 
This is the second S101 mouse and keyboard I have purchased. The first keyboard lasted 2 years before I had issues with it, so there was no hesitation in buying it again. The keyboard works great, and the backlit lights work perfect. It makes the keyboard easy to see and the lights are easy to adjust. I couldn't give it 5 stars because both times I purchased this set the mouse hasn't worked. I recommend buying the keyboard as it is great but don't expect anything from the mouse. I am not sure if I was just unlucky with both mice or if there is a quality issue with this model mouse. I went ahead and bought a Razer mouse, and it still works great. 5star keyboard, 0-star mouse.
