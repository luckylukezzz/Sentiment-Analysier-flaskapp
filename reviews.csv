5.0,"Works just like the name brand. 
So far, we have no complaints about this controller. It looks and feels the same as an authentic dual-shock controller. As others have said, the controls may be a little tighter to begin with, but that works itself out quickly. For the money, you can't beat this.

4.0,"About 85% as good as the Sony controller for about 33% of the price. 
I was having a lot of difficulties maintaining connection at first. Once I deleted all of my existing Bluetooth connections for controllers and reconnected it again via USB that issue seems to be resolved.Overall, the controller works well, but lacks the refinement of the original Sony controller. The sticks, and triggers in particular feel ""sluggish"".As a pretty casual gamer I am OK with the compromise in refinement given the massive price difference.The original Sony controllers typically last about 18 months before I develop ""stick drift"" and have to replace. Hopefully this one will last the same or longer.

3.0,"Lack of durability. 
I have purchased many of these controllers. From different sellers. The quality just is not good regardless of the manufacture producing it. There are several companies. The dead space is too noticeable, buttons stick or stop responding to input, thumb pads drift crazy, and all these things having happened on every one of these controllers, regardless of what Chinese company is making them.Now I’m fair so I will say that they didn’t deliver Brocken. besides feeling light the plastic did feel like decent quality. The problems started after about 600 hours of game play. One of the controllers I purchased the button stopped responding. Luckily I had a paddle I added to remap so I could still play while I waited on the delivery of a new controller. This was only after about 200 hours.Is it worth it? I’ve caught enough of them to suffer the frustration of controller malfunction in the middle of a game to say …. NO.HOWEVER… for the price, if you’re in a pinch, they will do. But if you can save up another $25, I’d just recommend getting an actual Ps4 controller.

4.0,"Great but not what you expect. 
The product is amazing overall, I was playing some Call of Duty and it works really fine, but due to it being a knock-off, the battery runs out quickly. I would say it could last maybe 4-5 hours without charge(will simultaneouly playing). But the main thing that I would say stood out for me was the product picture had a slight chromatic look towards it while in reality it is purely white. Main tip for everyone is KEEP THE WIRE THAT THEY PROVIDE YOU WITH! This is mainly for those who will bluetooth connect their controls to other devices for example their ipads. I had done that in which I tried to connect the controller back to my PS4 but wouldnt work. I then took a three way cable(usb-c, lightning, and older cable) and connected it to the PS4 in which would only charge the controller and now connect it. Until finally I got a old cable(old samsung cable) and connected it to the PS4 in which it finaly connected.

I recently purchased the Controller, and my experience has been quite disappointing. There are two major issues that have significantly impacted my gaming experience:1. **Analog Stick Drift**: The left analog stick has a persistent drift downwards, making it almost impossible to play games that require precise movements. This issue began shortly after I started using the controller, and it has only worsened over time. Whether I'm navigating menus or trying to control in-game characters, the unwanted downward movement is incredibly frustrating.2. **Bluetooth Connection Issues**: The controller frequently loses its Bluetooth connection to my console/PC. This instability disrupts gameplay and often requires multiple attempts to reconnect, which is both inconvenient and time-consuming. I expected a much more reliable wireless experience from a controller in this price range.Overall, the controller has been a letdown. The analog stick drift and Bluetooth connectivity problems overshadow any of its potential positive aspects. I would not recommend this controller to other gamers, as these fundamental issues greatly diminish its usability and enjoyment.

2.0,"okay for games without camera movement for right joystick. 
I didn't give a 1 star because i think overall the quality is actually there for how it feels compared to the original. For the price it's good if you want to use it for like jrpgs or games with little to no camera movement with the right joystick. I got this to try it out since it was so highly reviewed compared to an original Ps4 controller. I also got this to use on PC not a console. The first game i tried out was Elden ring and right away i noticed that when panning around with the camera unless you were directly on the E or W cardinal the camera speed would drastically slow down almost like you were trying to look up and down, which does not happen with my wired xbox pc controller. I also tried the panning speed in FFXIV, MHW, and Skyrim which all seem to act the same. So did some software troubleshooting with Ds4 for awhile to see if the issue could be corrected but it does seem to just be a hardware issue. Again the overall controller feel and responsiveness of the buttons/triggers/joystick feel similar to the original but i would not advise buying if you are looking at this as a full PS4 controller replacement or to actually use it on console. Ended up just spending the extra for another Ps4 original and it doesn't have the issue either.

3.0,"Great controller, not as durable as standard PS4 conteoller. 
Great controller for the price. I was very happy, but after a week of gameplay, my R2 trigger is noticeably looser than all the rest of the buttons.Given that this is one of the most used buttons in the gaming that I do, I can understand the wear and tear, but after only a week of gameplay, I don’t think one of the buttons should start wearing out already.Like I said, it was worth the price, but I do believe that you get what you pay for…I’ll just have to shell out a little bit more next time

The controls feel a bit stiffer, and it doesn’t have the weight of an official Sony controller, it has the functionality. My kid mostly plays ps4 games on the ps5, so we bought it in hopes of keeping the ps5 controller in the best condition possible lol. Though, it looks really good next to it. If you can’t get the official controller, this is a good alternative.

In all honesty besides the PS button shape and some graphics its a 1:1 of the real thing. Lasts just as long as my other controllers. Analog sticks feel great with no drift.

This is a great PS4 copy controller. It has almost the same feel as the official one with the exception of the smoothness of the plastic.
