This product does not have a manufacturer warranty rather a 30-day return period with seller. At just 9.3mm, the iPhone 4 is thin as a rake but the front and back are 30 times stronger than the usual plastic. Reason - aluminosilicate glass, the stuff that windshields of military choppers are made of. The periphery is customized alloy, 5 times stronger than steel. Your accidental dropping won\'t hurt your pocket-communicator. The Retina Display packs in 4 times the amount of pixels (326 per inch) of iPhone 3, and makes the text and images slicing sharp. Thanks to the added 960 x 640 pixel screen watching of HD movies on the iPhone 4 becomes a gasp. When you become a shutterbug behind the iPhone 4 camera, you shoot 5 megapixel images and high-definition videos at 720p resolution, with the LED flash and autofocus that make things easier. Opt for the iMovie video editing software, and you become a movie maker. If you happen to have Wi-Fi around, the FaceTime feature gets you into true worldwide video chat and \'staying in touch\' becomes real personal. And all it takes to choose between the front and rear camera is a tap. The 3-axis gyro, when coupled with accelerometer, results in 6-axis motion sensing, and that\'s as good as it can ever get for gaming on a cell phone. With 7 hours of talk time (3G)/10 hours of video/40 hours of audio, the iPhone 4 packs in enough power to let you do fast multitasking.','\'GSM Factory Unlocked: Device is unlocked for use on any GSM network, please contact your service provider prior to purchasing to ensure full compatibility.
