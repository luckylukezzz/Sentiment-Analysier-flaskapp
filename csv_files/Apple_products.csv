3.0,NOT That Great!!!,"I bought my iPhone 8 Plus 256GB through XFinity Mobile. They said Apple was having a Deal on these phones.

I had the same problem with 6S and Samsung S7. Lastly, these Smart Phones were made to get into your Business, especially the Apps!!! The tracking part was put under a different name compared to my 6S iPhone. Apple guy said he loved his phone, but it is not all that great to me. I use it mainly for talking, music and taking notes. My next phone will probably be a Flip phone and my last Apple product will be the iPad 10.5"" for size and speed. I had bought the 12.9"" and a iPhone 6S Plus and they both were defective! So, they were returned within a week!

It has had no problems with my numerous apps (a lot of fitness apps among others) and everything functions well. I have a diminished  battery life due to the reduced capacity of the battery.

There were some weird requirements for the return, including that I somehow send the tracking info to the seller, but no instructions or links on how to do that securely. I can’t seem to find ANY links to contact this particular seller, so I’m concerned about my refund. For past Amazon returns, my refund is usually “approved” once I get the return to the UPS drop off.

It has low speaker volume and this one also has a lower speaker phone volume than normal. I spent an hour on the phone with Apple support. They were unable to help fix this issue because it was a hardware issue. Needless to say this phone is also being returned. I will not be purchasing a phone from this company again.<br /><br />  I bought this renewed phone which stated excellent condition. There were scratches on the screen, with one deep scratch on the bottom left. Which was really no big deal as it didn’t interfere with the phone. On excellent condition phones, it states battery life at 80% or above. This phone had 77% battery life. It has low phone volume. When making a call it’s extremely hard to hear who your talking to with the ear speaker. The only way I was able to talk to people was using the speaker phone. This is the reason I’m sending it back.

So, last year I thought we'd try these refurbished iPhone 8’s from Amazon.

Both phones have worked great for the past 11 months, until two days ago, when my phone’s audio stopped working on phone calls.  However, the speaker still works, so it still works with phone calls, unless you want to have a private conversation, or use your Bluetooth.  Now, I have to decide whether to try to have it repaired, or try to buy another refurbished iPhone 8.

4.0,Nothing wrong,[[VIDEOID:d87a332558d2aa31a9834ef5c7c15978]] Okay. So I got my phone (iPhone 6s) off of Amazon 2 years ago. I had no problem with it.. until it just got too old. So I decided to buy i new phone( iPhone 8) because i needed more storage. And boom I found this one. I was really scared to buy it because obviously on every other post it talks about how bad they are. I was scared with this one because there was no reviews. I was horriblely scared since I got my iPhone 6s and it was perfect. I have no complaints about this iphone 1 it came fast ( don’t have prime) 2 no cracks or scratches. And yes there is 256 gbs 😍 so I am just happy happy !!,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610sZwUannL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610sZwUannL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610sZwUannL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7107jv6hooL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7107jv6hooL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7107jv6hooL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B078P38R8L,B078P38R8L,AFAH5XQB6IFL2FJ7W5OZU3GXVW6Q,1583508674398,22,True

5.0,Amazing.,"This is the best purchase I could have ever made. I had an iPhone 6s (very ancient) with the battery life span of a deer getting hit by a semi-truck going 60 mph. I charge this phone 1 time a day compared to charging my 6s about 10 times a day. A 3ft charging cord and a very cheap, plastic adapter came in the box as well as a very cheap and breakable sd card remover tool. My only complaint with this phone is it doesn't have a headphone plug, I ended up buying a headphone jack adaptor. So if you have a very ancient phone like I did and are planning on buying this phone or a newer iPhone, it's probably best that you invest in a headphone jack. That is if you're a music enjoyer.<br />With that being said if you plan on purchasing this phone, you won't (or you'll hardly)be let down.",[],B09JF5ZHQS,B09JF5ZHQS,AHQ6DH4BDF3VB2DA426OR4U5KBYA,1683130152120,2,True

4.0,"Good condition, bad battery.","I bought the iPhone 6 Gold 64GB from Wireless Warehouse. It was said to be in excellent condition I picked it up for about $400. I get the phone, overall it was in good condition. It had one little ding on the bottom right nothing too noticeable. After using it for about 2 days I noticed the battery life was absolutely dreadful. Luckily, the firmware was on 9.3.3 so it could be jailbroken. I jailbroke the iPhone I downloaded a tweak to give me information about my battery life it's at ~40-60% capacity it likes to jump around, it had over 800 charges. The iPhone was used a lot I could tell. So I am going to order an external battery and take apart the phone. Now if anyone else has a bad battery and they need to switch it out I recommend you go with extreme caution. If you're not comfortable with doing it then I highly recommend you don't do it. If you can pay apple their fee (which I think is roughly $100) then I would do that. However, I don't really feel apple should get $100 for a battery you can pick up for $20. But again I am fairly comfortable with taking apart my phone.
